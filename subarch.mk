# SUBARCH tells the usermode build what the underlying arch is.  That is set
# first, and if a usermode build is happening, the "ARCH=um" on the command
# line overrides the setting of ARCH below.  If a native build is happening,
# then ARCH is assigned, getting whatever value it gets normally, and
# SUBARCH is subsequently ignored.

# Cross compiling and selecting different set of gcc/bin-utils
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# When performing cross compilation for other architectures ARCH shall be set
# to the target architecture. (Only x86 and ARM 32/64bits supported).
# ARCH can be set during invocation of kmake:
# kmake ARCH=i386
# Another way is to have ARCH set in the environment.
# The default ARCH is the host where kmake is executed.

# CROSS_COMPILE specify the prefix used for all executables used
# during compilation. Only gcc and related bin-utils executables
# are prefixed with $(CROSS_COMPILE).
# CROSS_COMPILE can be set on the command line
# kmake CROSS_COMPILE=i686-linux-
# Alternatively CROSS_COMPILE can be set in the environment.
# Default value for CROSS_COMPILE is not to prefix executables
